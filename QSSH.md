SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used to securely access and manage devices, computers, and servers over an unsecured network like the internet. It encrypts the connection between the SSH client and the SSH server, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.

### Components of SSH Communication:

1. **SSH Client**: The device that initiates the connection to the server.
2. **SSH Server**: The device that accepts the connection and provides the requested services.
3. **SSH Protocol**: The rules governing the establishment and maintenance of the communication.

### Steps in SSH Communication:

1. **Client Initiates Connection**: The client opens a TCP connection to the SSH server, typically on port 22.
2. **Version Exchange**: The client and server exchange protocol versions and software information to ensure compatibility.
3. **Key Exchange**: Both parties agree on a symmetric encryption key, which is used to encrypt the session. This is done through a Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, which allows two parties to generate a shared secret over an unsecured channel without actually sharing the secret directly.
4. **Authentication**: After the key exchange, the client authenticates itself to the server using one of several methods (password, public key, etc.). Once authenticated, the server may also authenticate itself to the client (mutual authentication).
5. **Session Encryption**: After authentication, the SSH session is fully encrypted, and the client and server can exchange data securely.

### How SSH Handshake Works:

The SSH handshake ensures that the communication is secure and protected from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

#### 1. **TCP Connection**:
   - The client initiates a TCP connection on port 22, and the server responds, indicating it's listening for incoming SSH requests.

#### 2. **Protocol and Software Version Exchange**:
   - Both the client and the server exchange version strings to determine if they are compatible. This ensures that they both support the same version of the SSH protocol.

#### 3. **Key Exchange**:
   - The SSH key exchange process allows both parties to negotiate cryptographic algorithms and derive a session key to use for encryption.

##### Key Exchange Process:
   - **Diffie-Hellman** or **Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman** is typically used here.
   - Client and server agree on a large prime number and a base (shared between them).
   - The client and server each generate a random number and calculate their public values.
   - These public values are exchanged between the client and server.
   - Both the client and server use the public values to generate a shared secret key (without sending the secret key itself).
   - The session key derived from this process is then used to encrypt the rest of the communication.

   During this step, both sides also exchange their public keys, which are verified to ensure the authenticity of the connection.

#### 4. **Server Authentication**:
   - The server sends its public key to the client, which the client checks to verify the server's authenticity (either through certificates or fingerprints stored in known hosts).
   - The server uses its private key to sign certain data, proving that it holds the corresponding private key to the public key it just shared.
   
#### 5. **Client Authentication**:
   - The client authenticates to the server using methods like password-based authentication or **public key authentication** (which is more secure). 
   - **Public key authentication**: The client generates a key pair (private and public key). The public key is copied to the server, and when logging in, the server verifies the public key by using the client's private key to sign a challenge, ensuring secure authentication.

#### 6. **Secure Session Establishment**:
   - After the authentication process is complete, the SSH connection enters an encrypted state, and a secure session is established.
   - All data exchanged between the client and server is now encrypted using the session key derived earlier in the key exchange.

### Types of SSH Communication:

1. **SSH-1**:
   - The original version of the SSH protocol, but it's now considered insecure due to vulnerabilities.
   - It only supports password-based authentication and lacks modern cryptographic algorithms.

2. **SSH-2**:
   - The current and more secure version of SSH.
   - It provides stronger cryptography and is more modular, supporting multiple algorithms for key exchange, encryption, and message authentication.
   - Common encryption algorithms: AES, Blowfish, ChaCha20.
   - Message authentication algorithms: HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code), SHA-2.
   - Key exchange algorithms: Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman.

### Types of Authentication Methods in SSH:

1. **Password-Based Authentication**:
   - The client sends an encrypted password to the server, which verifies it.
   - While simple, it's less secure than public key authentication.

2. **Public Key Authentication**:
   - The client uses its private key to authenticate, and the server verifies it using the client's public key.
   - It's more secure than password authentication because the private key never leaves the client.

3. **Keyboard-Interactive Authentication**:
   - The server sends a series of challenges (prompts), and the user responds, often used in multi-factor authentication (MFA).

4. **GSSAPI Authentication**:
   - Used in environments where Kerberos is deployed for single sign-on.

### Types of SSH Services:

1. **SSH Terminal (Remote Command Execution)**:
   - Allows users to securely execute commands on a remote server.
   
2. **SSH File Transfer (SFTP, SCP)**:
   - SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) provides secure file transfer.
   - SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) allows users to copy files between client and server using SSH.

3. **SSH Port Forwarding (Tunneling)**:
   - **Local Port Forwarding**: Redirects traffic from a local machine to a remote server via SSH (used to bypass firewalls).
   - **Remote Port Forwarding**: Forwards traffic from the remote server to the local client.
   - **Dynamic Port Forwarding**: Used to create an encrypted SOCKS proxy.

SSH ensures secure communication with encryption and authentication mechanisms, providing various forms of secure remote management and data transfer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certificate-based authentication in SSH is an extension of public key authentication, where a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) issues and signs the client and server certificates. This method enhances the security of traditional public key authentication by verifying the authenticity of the keys using a centralized, trusted authority. It's especially useful in large environments where managing individual public keys can become cumbersome.

### How Certificate-Based Authentication Works:

1. **Certificate Authority (CA)**:
   - A CA is a trusted entity that signs the SSH public key certificates for both clients and servers.
   - The CA's public key (called the "CA public key") is distributed to all servers and clients.

2. **SSH Certificate Format**:
   - An SSH certificate is an SSH public key with additional metadata, including:
     - **Principals**: The user or host names that the certificate is valid for.
     - **Expiration Time**: A timestamp defining the certificate's validity period.
     - **Critical Options**: Certain restrictions, like limiting port forwarding.
     - **Extensions**: Features like granting or denying specific capabilities.
     - **Signature**: The CA’s signature, ensuring the certificate was issued by a trusted source.

3. **Certificate Types**:
   - **User Certificates**: Issued to users for client-side authentication.
   - **Host Certificates**: Issued to servers to authenticate their identity during SSH connections.

### Steps in SSH Certificate-Based Authentication:

#### 1. **CA Generates and Signs Certificates**:
   - The CA creates certificates for users and hosts by taking their public keys and adding metadata like the principals (usernames or hostnames) and expiration times.
   - The CA then signs the certificate with its private key, creating a valid certificate that proves the public key belongs to the user or server specified in the certificate.

#### 2. **Distribute CA Public Key**:
   - The CA’s public key is distributed to all SSH servers and clients in the network.
   - On the server side, the CA's public key is stored in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file or `/etc/ssh/ca_authorized_keys`.
   - On the client side, the CA's public key is stored in the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file, allowing the client to trust server certificates signed by this CA.

#### 3. **Client Requests Connection with Certificate**:
   - The client initiates the SSH connection and provides its certificate (which contains its public key, metadata, and the CA's signature) to the SSH server for authentication.

#### 4. **Server Verifies Client Certificate**:
   - The server validates the certificate by:
     - Checking if the CA's public key (used to sign the certificate) is trusted.
     - Verifying that the certificate is still valid (not expired).
     - Ensuring that the principal (username) in the certificate matches the user requesting the connection.
     - Ensuring that critical options or extensions in the certificate allow the requested operation.

   If all checks pass, the server knows the certificate was issued by a trusted CA and that the client’s identity is legitimate.

#### 5. **Client Authenticates Server (Optional)**:
   - Similarly, the client may also authenticate the server using a server (host) certificate. The client will verify that the server’s certificate is signed by a trusted CA and that the server is who it claims to be.
   
#### 6. **Encrypted SSH Session Established**:
   - After successful certificate-based authentication, the encrypted SSH session is established, and communication begins.

### Benefits of Certificate-Based SSH Authentication:

1. **Simplified Key Management**:
   - Administrators no longer need to manually distribute and manage individual public keys across systems. Instead, the CA handles certificate issuance and expiration.

2. **Scalability**:
   - In large environments, maintaining thousands of individual SSH keys is cumbersome. Certificates allow for easier management of keys across users and hosts.
   
3. **Revocation and Expiry**:
   - Certificates come with expiration dates, meaning access is automatically revoked after a certain time. Also, compromised certificates can be easily revoked by the CA.

4. **Reduced Trust on Individual Keys**:
   - Since the CA vouches for the public keys, trust is placed on the CA rather than individual users or systems, increasing overall security.

5. **Automatic Rotation**:
   - The system can periodically generate new certificates with updated expiration times, reducing the risk of compromised credentials being used for extended periods.

### Example of SSH Certificate-Based Authentication:

#### 1. **Creating a CA Key**:
   First, the CA generates a key pair to sign certificates:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -f /path/to/ca -t rsa
   ```

#### 2. **Creating a Client Certificate**:
   Assuming the user already has an SSH key pair (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`), the CA can sign the user’s public key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -s /path/to/ca -I username -n username -V +52w /path/to/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   - `-s /path/to/ca`: The CA’s private key used for signing.
   - `-I username`: A certificate identity string.
   - `-n username`: The principal (username) that the certificate is valid for.
   - `-V +52w`: Validity period (52 weeks).
   - `/path/to/id_rsa.pub`: The user's public key to be signed.

#### 3. **Configuring the Server to Trust the CA**:
   On the SSH server, the CA’s public key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file or `/etc/ssh/ca_authorized_keys` file:
   ```bash
   echo "@cert-authority *.example.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD..." >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
   This allows the server to trust certificates signed by the CA for all clients connecting under the domain `*.example.com`.

#### 4. **Client Connecting with Certificate**:
   The client can now connect to the SSH server using the certificate:
   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/id_rsa user@hostname
   ```
   The SSH client sends the certificate along with the connection request, and the server verifies it with the CA’s public key.

### Summary:
Certificate-based SSH authentication simplifies key management, enhances security, and scales better in large environments. It builds on public key authentication, with the addition of a trusted CA that issues and verifies certificates for both users and hosts.

This setup aims to ensure that SSH communication is secure against both classical and quantum threats.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In an SSH (Secure Shell) communication session, several steps and cryptographic algorithms work together to establish a secure connection between the client and server. The process involves multiple phases, including key exchange (KEX), server authentication, encryption, message integrity verification, compression, and language negotiation. Here's a detailed breakdown of how these algorithms and parameters come together to establish a secure SSH session:

### 1. **Session Setup and Negotiation (SSH Handshake)**

   **Goal:** Agree on a set of cryptographic algorithms and establish a shared secret for encrypting communication.

   The SSH handshake is the first phase of communication between a client and a server. This phase involves:
   - Negotiating which cryptographic algorithms will be used.
   - Authenticating the server.
   - Generating session keys.

### 2. **Client Sends SSH_INIT Packet**

   The client sends a **`SSH_INIT`** packet that includes a list of supported algorithms for various aspects of the SSH session:
   
   - **KEX Algorithms:** Algorithms for securely exchanging a key between the client and server.
   - **Host Key Algorithms:** Used for server authentication.
   - **Encryption Algorithms (Client-to-Server and Server-to-Client):** Algorithms for encrypting the communication after the key exchange.
   - **MAC Algorithms (Client-to-Server and Server-to-Client):** Algorithms for ensuring the integrity of the data being transferred.
   - **Compression Algorithms:** Used to compress data before encryption.
   - **Languages:** Indicates the preferred language for communication (usually not used).

   Example parameters from your provided data:
   - **KEX Algorithms:** `ecdh-nistp384-kyber-768r3-sha384-d00@openquantumsafe.org, ext-info-c`
   - **Server Host Key Algorithms:** `ssh-ecdsa-nistp384-dilithium3`
   - **Encryption Algorithms:** `chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com, aes128-ctr, aes256-gcm@openssh.com`
   - **MAC Algorithms:** `umac-64-etm@openssh.com, hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com`
   - **Compression Algorithms:** `none, zlib@openssh.com`

### 3. **Server Responds with SSH_INIT**

   The server responds with its own **`SSH_INIT`** packet that also lists supported algorithms. The client and server agree on the strongest mutually supported algorithms from their respective lists.

   - The server will pick the strongest algorithm from the client’s proposals that it also supports.
   - For example, if both support `ecdh-nistp384-kyber-768r3-sha384-d00`, that KEX algorithm will be chosen.

### 4. **Key Exchange (KEX)**

   **Goal:** Securely generate a shared secret key between the client and server.

   The KEX (Key Exchange) algorithm is the first major step in establishing a secure session. In your example, a **post-quantum hybrid key exchange** is used:
   
   - **`ecdh-nistp384-kyber-768r3-sha384-d00@openquantumsafe.org`**: This combines **ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)**, a classical key exchange algorithm, with **Kyber-768**, a post-quantum key exchange algorithm, to establish a shared secret that both the client and server know. The result is a robust key exchange resistant to both classical and quantum computing attacks.

   During this step:
   - Both the client and server use their private keys and exchange public keys to generate the shared secret.
   - **SHA-384** (a cryptographic hash function) is used to hash data during this process to ensure integrity.

### 5. **Server Authentication with Host Key Algorithm**

   **Goal:** Authenticate the server to the client to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

   The server uses a **host key algorithm** to prove its identity. In your case:
   
   - The server sends a signature using the `ssh-ecdsa-nistp384-dilithium3` algorithm.
     - **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)** provides classical cryptographic authentication.
     - **Dilithium3** provides post-quantum security.

   The client uses the server's public host key, which it either already knows (from a previous connection) or is provided during the handshake. The client verifies the server's authenticity by checking the signature.

### 6. **Session Encryption Initialization**

   **Goal:** Establish encrypted communication channels for data transmission.

   Once the key exchange is complete, the client and server agree on encryption algorithms. Two types of encryption algorithms are chosen:
   
   - **Client-to-Server Encryption Algorithm:** This encrypts data sent by the client.
   - **Server-to-Client Encryption Algorithm:** This encrypts data sent by the server.

   In your session, the chosen encryption algorithms might be:
   - **`chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com`**: A fast stream cipher with built-in authentication (Poly1305) for encrypting and verifying messages.
   - **`aes128-ctr`**, **`aes256-gcm@openssh.com`**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with either Counter (CTR) mode or Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for strong encryption with authenticity checks.

   These algorithms are applied symmetrically, meaning both the client and server can now encrypt and decrypt data using the shared secret derived from the key exchange.

### 7. **Message Integrity Check with MAC Algorithms**

   **Goal:** Ensure data integrity and authenticity.

   The MAC (Message Authentication Code) algorithm verifies that data hasn’t been tampered with during transmission. Each packet is hashed, and the hash is checked to ensure integrity.

   Examples from your session:
   - **`umac-64-etm@openssh.com`**: UMAC (Universal Message Authentication Code) with 64-bit output and Encrypt-then-MAC mode.
   - **`hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com`**: HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code) using SHA-256, a secure hashing algorithm, also in Encrypt-then-MAC mode.

   These MAC algorithms are applied to both the client-to-server and server-to-client communication, ensuring data is protected from tampering in both directions.

### 8. **Compression Algorithms**

   **Goal:** Optionally compress data to reduce bandwidth usage before encryption.

   The client and server may agree on a compression algorithm to reduce the size of data being transmitted. In your session, options are:
   - **None**: No compression.
   - **`zlib@openssh.com`**: A compression algorithm commonly used to reduce data size.

   Typically, compression happens before encryption and after decryption to prevent attackers from using compression to infer information about the plaintext (this is called a compression side-channel attack).

### 9. **Language Negotiation (Optional)**

   **Goal:** Define the language for data encoding (rarely used).

   Although the languages parameters are present, they are usually empty, meaning no specific language negotiation takes place during most SSH sessions.

### 10. **Completion of Handshake**

   At this point, the **"First KEX Packet Follows"** parameter can come into play:
   - If set to `1`, it indicates that the first key exchange packet from the client follows immediately after the negotiation (saving time).
   - In your session, it’s set to `0`, meaning the handshake proceeds in separate steps.

   The **Reserved** field is usually a placeholder for future extensions or backward compatibility.

### 11. **Session Establishment**

   Once the SSH handshake process is complete:
   - Both sides now have the shared secret, and all further communication is encrypted and authenticated.
   - The **hasshServerAlgorithms** parameter stores a fingerprint of the agreed-upon algorithms, providing a way to uniquely identify the server’s configuration in future connections.

### Summary of Roles of Each Parameter:

- **KEX Algorithms**: Establishes a secure shared secret for encryption.
- **Server Host Key Algorithms**: Authenticates the server to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Encryption Algorithms**: Encrypts data to ensure confidentiality.
- **MAC Algorithms**: Ensures data integrity and authenticity.
- **Compression Algorithms**: Optionally compresses data to save bandwidth.
- **Languages**: Rarely used, defines encoding languages.
- **First KEX Packet Follows**: Optimizes handshake timing by sending the first packet right after negotiation.
- **hasshServerAlgorithms**: Creates a unique identifier for the server's configuration.

Together, these elements establish a secure SSH connection that protects both the confidentiality and integrity of the communication between the client and server.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is an algorithmic sketch of how SSH communication is established, incorporating the key steps, negotiation phases, and usage of cryptographic algorithms:

### Algorithm Sketch for SSH Communication Establishment

```plaintext
1. Client Initiates Connection:
   - Client sends `SSH_INIT` packet to server with lists of supported algorithms:
     - KEX algorithms
     - Server host key algorithms
     - Encryption algorithms (client-to-server, server-to-client)
     - MAC algorithms (client-to-server, server-to-client)
     - Compression algorithms
     - Language preferences (optional)

2. Server Responds:
   - Server replies with its own `SSH_INIT` packet, listing its supported algorithms.

     - Server host key algorithm
     - Encryption algorithms (for both directions)
     - MAC algorithms (for both directions)
     - Compression algorithms (optional)

3. Key Exchange (KEX) Phase:
   - Both client and server use the agreed KEX algorithm to establish a shared secret:
     - Example: `ecdh-nistp384-kyber-768r3-sha384-d00`
     - Client and server exchange public keys.
     - Using their private keys, they compute a shared secret.
     - **SHA-384** is used for hashing in this example.
   - Both parties now have the same shared secret.

4. Server Authentication:
   - Server authenticates itself by signing data with its private key using the agreed **server host key algorithm**:
     - Example: `ssh-ecdsa-nistp384-dilithium3`
   - Client verifies the signature using the server’s public key.
   - If the signature is valid, the server is authenticated.

5. Session Encryption Setup:
   - Both client and server initialize encryption for the session using the shared secret.
   - Agreed encryption algorithms for client-to-server and server-to-client are used:
     - Example: `chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com`, `aes128-ctr`, `aes256-gcm@openssh.com`

6. Message Integrity Setup:
   - Client and server configure message integrity using the agreed **MAC algorithms**:
     - Example: `umac-64-etm@openssh.com`, `hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com`
   - Each packet sent between client and server will be authenticated using these algorithms to ensure integrity.

7. Optional Compression:
   - If agreed, compression is applied using the **compression algorithms** before encryption.
     - Example: `zlib@openssh.com`, or no compression (`none`).

8. First Key Exchange Packet Follows:
   - If `First KEX Packet Follows = 1`, the client sends the first key exchange packet immediately after the negotiation, optimizing time.
   - Otherwise, the process continues sequentially.

9. Reserved Field:
   - Reserved field is left unused but may be included for future extension or compatibility.

10. Secure Session Established:
   - Both client and server now possess:
     - A shared encryption key (derived from KEX).
     - Configured encryption and MAC algorithms for secure and authenticated communication.
     - Compression (if enabled).
   - Further data exchange between client and server is now encrypted, compressed (if agreed), and authenticated.

11. **hasshServerAlgorithms** (optional):
   - Server generates a fingerprint (`hasshServerAlgorithms`) of the agreed-upon algorithms.
   - This fingerprint can be stored for future connections or analysis.

12. Communication Continues:
   - Encrypted, authenticated, and optionally compressed communication begins.
   - Client and server exchange data securely using the established session.

13. Termination:
   - When the session is finished, the client sends an `SSH_DISCONNECT` packet.
   - The server acknowledges and the session is closed.
```

### Key Steps in the Algorithm:

1. **Algorithm Negotiation**: The client and server negotiate cryptographic algorithms (KEX, host key, encryption, MAC, compression).
2. **Key Exchange (KEX)**: A shared secret is established using the agreed KEX algorithm.
3. **Server Authentication**: The server authenticates itself with a digital signature.
4. **Session Encryption**: Encryption is established for both client-to-server and server-to-client communication.
5. **Message Authentication (MAC)**: MAC algorithms are set up to ensure data integrity.
6. **Optional Compression**: If supported, compression is enabled.
7. **Secure Communication**: Data transfer begins with all agreed security measures in place.

This algorithm sketch outlines the key steps involved in establishing a secure SSH session, illustrating how the various parameters like KEX, encryption, and MAC algorithms come together to ensure secure communication.

so explain the above communication is established correctly using PQC and also explain the entire session and how it is established

The session you’ve described represents a **complete SSH handshake** between a client and server, where both parties agree on key exchange algorithms and encryption methods, including **post-quantum cryptographic (PQC)** algorithms. Here's a breakdown of how the session is established and how these cryptographic parameters work together to secure the communication.

### Step-by-Step Explanation of the SSH Handshake

1. **Protocol Version Exchange:**
   - **Client:**
     ```
     SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9-2022-01_
     ```
     The client initiates the communication by sending its SSH protocol version to the server. This specifies that it’s using **SSH Version 2**.
   
   - **Server:**
     ```
     SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.9-2022-01_
     ```
     The server responds by also declaring its protocol version (SSH Version 2). This version exchange is essential to ensure both the client and server are using compatible protocol versions.

2. **Key Exchange Initialization (KEX Init):**
   - **Client:**
     ```
     Key Exchange Init (Message Code: 20)
     ```
     The client starts the **key exchange negotiation** by sending a list of cryptographic algorithms it supports. These include:
     - **Key Exchange Algorithm:** `ecdh-nistp384-kyber-768r3-sha384-d00@openquantumsafe.org` (a hybrid classical/post-quantum algorithm).
     - **Encryption Algorithm (Client-to-Server):** `chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com` (providing both encryption and authentication).
     - **MAC Algorithm (Message Authentication Code):** Implicit, as it’s handled by `chacha20-poly1305`.
     - **Compression:** `none`.
     - **Padding Length:** Ensures alignment with block sizes required by the encryption algorithm.

   - **Server:**
     ```
     Key Exchange Init (Message Code: 20)
     ```
     The server sends its own list of supported algorithms, which must overlap with the client’s list for the session to continue. The server also supports the **same hybrid PQC algorithm** and **chacha20-poly1305** for encryption.

3. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Init (DH Init):**
   - **Client:**
     ```
     Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Init (Message Code: 30)
     ```
     After the algorithms are agreed upon, the client starts the key exchange using **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)** combined with **Kyber-768**, a post-quantum key exchange algorithm. This hybrid algorithm provides both classical security and protection against future quantum attacks.
     - **Invalid Key Length (1281):** An issue is flagged in the length of the client’s DH public key (potentially due to a misconfiguration or mismatch in key size expectations). Despite this error, the communication continues.
     - The client sends a **multi-precision integer** (`DH client e`), which is its public key used in the key exchange process.

4. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Reply & New Keys (Server to Client):**
   - **Server:**
     ```
     Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Reply (Message Code: 31)
     ```
     The server replies with its **own public key** (`DH server f`) and a **host key**, which is used to authenticate the server to the client. In this case, the host key is based on **`ssh-ecdsa-nistp384-dilithium3`**, a combination of classical ECDSA and the post-quantum algorithm Dilithium3.
     - **Invalid Key Length (1185):** Again, the key length seems incorrect, but the session proceeds. This error may indicate a mismatch or an implementation quirk in how the key sizes are negotiated.
     - The server also signs the **host key** using the hybrid signature algorithm `ssh-ecdsa-nistp384-dilithium3`, proving its identity to the client.
   
   - **New Keys Message:**
     After the server sends the necessary data for the key exchange, both the client and server send a **New Keys message (Message Code: 21)**, indicating that the key exchange is complete, and they will now begin using the new keys to encrypt and authenticate the communication.
     - **Encryption Algorithm (Chacha20-Poly1305):** Both client and server will use **chacha20-poly1305** for encryption and implicit authentication for the session.
     - **Compression:** None.

5. **Completion of the Handshake:**
   Once both parties have sent and acknowledged the **New Keys message**, the SSH session is fully established. All subsequent communication will be encrypted using the agreed-upon keys, and the integrity of the messages will be guaranteed by the cryptographic algorithms.

### How the Parameters Come Together

1. **Key Exchange Algorithms (KEX Algorithms):**
   - The KEX algorithm used is **`ecdh-nistp384-kyber-768r3-sha384-d00@openquantumsafe.org`**, which combines classical elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) with **Kyber-768** to provide quantum-resistant key exchange. This ensures that even if a quantum computer were available in the future, the derived session keys would still be secure.
   - The server and client exchange **public keys** (the client’s `DH client e` and the server’s `DH server f`) to derive a shared secret. This shared secret is used to create the session key for encryption.

2. **Server Host Key Algorithms:**
   - The server authenticates itself using **`ssh-ecdsa-nistp384-dilithium3`**, which is another hybrid algorithm combining ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) with **Dilithium3** for post-quantum security.
   - The client uses this host key to verify that it is communicating with the correct server, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

3. **Encryption Algorithms (Client-to-Server and Server-to-Client):**
   - Both directions use **`chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com`** for encryption and authentication. This algorithm provides both confidentiality and data integrity in a single operation, eliminating the need for a separate MAC algorithm.

4. **MAC Algorithms (Client-to-Server and Server-to-Client):**
   - Since **chacha20-poly1305** includes integrated authentication, no explicit MAC algorithm is used. Instead, authentication is provided by the **Poly1305** component within the encryption algorithm.

5. **Compression Algorithms:**
   - Compression is disabled (`none`) in this session. If enabled, it could reduce the amount of data transferred, but it's often turned off to prevent certain types of attacks that exploit compression (like the CRIME attack).

6. **Padding & Sequence Numbers:**
   - **Padding Length**: Each packet includes padding to align with the block size of the encryption algorithm (in this case, Chacha20 uses stream encryption, but padding is still required for protocol consistency).
   - **Sequence Numbers**: These ensure the packets are in the correct order and allow detection of lost or replayed packets.

### Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) Integration

In this session, PQC algorithms (Kyber-768 and Dilithium3) are integrated with classical cryptographic methods (ECDH and ECDSA) to provide hybrid security:
- **Key Exchange (Kyber-768)**: Protects against future quantum computers during the key exchange process.
- **Authentication (Dilithium3)**: Ensures that the server’s identity is quantum-safe.
- These algorithms are included as part of the **Open Quantum Safe** project, which aims to integrate quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms into common protocols like SSH.

### Conclusion

This SSH session establishes secure communication between the client and server using a combination of classical and post-quantum cryptography. The process follows the SSH Version 2 protocol, beginning with the protocol exchange, followed by key exchange, and ending with the encryption of all subsequent messages. The hybrid cryptographic algorithms used ensure that the session is secure against both current threats and potential future quantum-based attacks.
